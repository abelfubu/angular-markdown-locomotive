  <h4>About me</h4>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is Abel and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web
    development started back in 2015 when I decided to try editing Wordpress sites â€” turns out
    hacking together a custom site taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
  </p>

  <p>
    Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a
    start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is
    building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of
    clients.

  <p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>

      <li>React</li>
      <li>Typescript</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>RxJs</li>
      <li>NgRx</li>
      <li>Nest.js</li>
    </ul>
